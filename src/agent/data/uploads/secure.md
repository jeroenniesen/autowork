Security should be available for everyone. In an era where every organization can let their employees work from everywhere at any given time, security becomes more complex.  For each new technology, Wortell has a companion security service.

Wortell offers a Managed Detection and Response, a SOC-as-a-service, to secure your Azure subscriptions and Microsoft 365 environment. With this managed service, Wortell will provide security monitoring as well as incident response. The service also includes threat intelligence feeds and custom machine learning models.

Depending on your security requirements, you can subscribe to the Wortell Protect packages that correspond with the technologies that you use. The following packages are available: Wortell Protect for Office 365, Wortell Protect for Devices, Wortell Protect for Azure.
